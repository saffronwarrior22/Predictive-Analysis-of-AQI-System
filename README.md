Air pollution has a significant impact on human health and the environment. This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning techniques based on historical air quality data. By analyzing key pollutant concentrations, the system predicts AQI values and categorizes air quality levels to support awareness, monitoring, and decision-making.


Objectives:
Analyze historical air quality data.

Predict AQI using machine learning models.

Classify air quality into standard AQI categories.

Provide a simple and user-friendly prediction system.

Machine Learning Workflow:
Data collection and preprocessing.
Feature selection and normalization.
Model training using supervised learning.
Model evaluation and prediction.


Output:
Predicts AQI value based on pollutant inputs.
Displays air quality category (Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.).
Shows graphical visualization of air quality trends.
